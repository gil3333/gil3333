# 👋 Hi, I'm Gil Harary

**Software Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | CS @ Holon Institute of Technology**

I’m a software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals and hands-on experience building production-style full-stack applications.  
I enjoy working end-to-end — from system design and backend APIs to clean, scalable frontend UIs.
